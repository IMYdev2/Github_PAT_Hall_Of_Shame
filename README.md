# Github_PAT_Hall_Of_Shame
Testing github's PAT expiration. If you see any PAT exposed in public, send it here

Explanation:
This project demonstrates that if you ignore the warnings and push PAT to a public repo, or even add it inside a PR, it'll expire. 

You can do this without this repo as well, just make a public repo on your account. If you want to delete any of these names, just send a PR and I will merge it.
